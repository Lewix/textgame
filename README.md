John's mountain biking adventure
================================

Game
----

The Game class will have one of each of the I/O system's classes (except Command). It will probably also need a handle on the Player class.

I/O System
----------

Made up of four classes: Listener, Modifier, Printer and Command. Listener and Modifier pass around Commands generated from user input. Modifier then changes the game state. Printer takes care of all the output from the game.

To-do
-----


* TODO: write CommandFormatException case 1: player.goRight(); 

* TODO: say where to go 

* TODO: visibility of the enums methods 

* TODO: binary search in arrays is a bit shit 

* TODO: Colin implements makeMap while (true) { 

* TODO: success condition 

* TODO: print text 

* TODO: initiate map 

* TODO: location = someIndex ; 

* TODO 

* TODO: write printState (and others for different parts of state)

(don't write anything past this point)
