John's mountain biking adventure
================================

Game
----

The Game class will have one of each of the I/O system's classes (except Command). It will probably also need a handle on the Player class.

I/O System
----------

Made up of four classes: Listener, Modifier, Printer and Command. Listener and Modifier pass around Commands generated from user input. Modifier then changes the game state. Printer takes care of all the output from the game.
